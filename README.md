# 🤖 AI Web Design Crew — Multi-Agent Collaboration with CrewAI

## 📍 Overview
This project demonstrates how a **team of autonomous AI agents** can collaborate to design and build a full web application from scratch.  
It was developed using **CrewAI** with **GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini** models, each agent having a specialized role (planner, designer, developer, tester).

The goal is to explore **multi-agent coordination**, **autonomous task division**, and **collaborative problem solving** in real-world development workflows.
